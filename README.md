	A toast will be used to communicate with the user in the event of an error.
	
**2. Buttons and User Interface:**
	Buttons will be required to properly allow for user interaction
	
**3. RecyclerView:**
	A RecyclerView will be required for the purpose of holding a history of past calculations.
	
**4. Accessing External Resources:**
	Some button symbols necessary will not be available intrinsically, and so must be added from an external library.
